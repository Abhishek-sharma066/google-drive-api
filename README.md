## Setting Up Credentials

1. Copy the `credentials.example.php` file and rename it to `credentials.php`.
2. Open the `credentials.php` file and replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:
   - `CLIENT_ID`: Your OAuth client ID from the Google Developer Console.
   - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your OAuth client secret from the Google Developer Console.
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN`: The refresh token you get after completing the OAuth flow.
3. **Make sure to use the correct OAuth scopes** for the features you need. Without the right scopes, some features may not work properly. For example, to access Google Drive, youâ€™ll need the Drive API scope.

That's it! Now your credentials are set up and ready to go.
